#DISTRIBUTIONS

#P(x=a)
#P(x>=a) ::: Can't use in this formula. Have to convert in 1st or 3rd
#P(x<=a)
#x=0,1,2,3,4,5

#Binomial   binom  equality= dnorm   less than equal- pnorm (atmost)
#Normal     norm   equality= dnorm   less than equal- pnorm (atmost)
#Poisson    pois   equality= dnorm   less than equal- pnorm (atmost)
#Hyper-Geometric
#Bernouli
 
P(x=7)+P(x=8)+P(x=9) or P(x<=9)-P(x<=6) or P(7<=x<=9)
6 is the denotation

#Binomial Distribution
#nCr.pr.q(n-r)
dbinom(a,n,p)  : a is startung value or atmost, n is total number of values, p is the prob of the asked 1. Eg- Prob of 6 in dice
pbinom(a,n,p)

dbinom(7,12,1/6)+dbinom(8,12,1/6)+dbinom(9,12,1/6)
pbinom can't work like the above
so
pbinome(9,12,1/6)-pbinom(6,12,1/6)      3 arguments
Always integer if integer.
But normal distribution is continuous


#Q2: 
#NORMAL DISTRIBUTION: GRAPH- About the axis- similar. Left and right are identically similar
#Point of intersection of axis is mean
#P(x>=84)   : have to change it in other form but in case of graph can do directly
#1-P(x<=84)
#We have choice of left and right in graph
#Inequaltiy: p
pnorm(84, 72,15.2, lower.tail=T)   #prob element, mean, standard dev, lower tail i.e., which side
#Eg- two ranges then???  It will be difficult to convert. so use lower.tail

##########P(69<=x<=85),      P(85<=x<=90)


#Q3.
#pois
#dpois   (1st position, lambda)
dpois(0,5)
#48<=x<=50

P(x<=50)-P(x<=47)
ppois(50,50)-ppois(47,50)       here 2 arhuments, (case,....)



#IF NOT MENTIONED WHICH DISTRIBUTION? STIPULATE WHICH IS THE BEST DISTRIBUTION.



#Hypergeometry-----------------
#dhyper(a,m,n,k)
#defective bulb case
a=3, defective case   (demand)
k- kitne mein se
m- 12 how much total defective in given data
n- non defective



#Q5:
#Randomly distributed- then?
#x=0,1,2,3.................. till 31
#How?
